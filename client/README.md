🎯 Vouchr – Your Complete Volunteer Engagement Platform
“Powering social impact through better volunteer coordination.”

🧩 What Is Vouchr?
Vouchr is a modern, easy-to-use platform designed specifically for NGOs and community-driven organizations to manage all aspects of volunteer engagement — from sign-ups and event tracking to attendance, communication, and recognition.

Whether you're running a cleanliness drive, a health camp, or an education program, Vouchr gives you one place to coordinate your volunteers, monitor their contributions, and build lasting relationships.

🛠️ What Can You Do with Vouchr?
Here’s a walk-through of how it works and what it helps you achieve:

👥 1. Volunteer Registration & Login
Volunteers can easily register and log in securely.

Admins get a separate, secure login with special privileges.

Everyone has their own dashboard — volunteers see their impact; admins see full stats.

📅 2. Create & Manage Events
Admins can create events (like blood donation camps, tree plantations).

Volunteers can sign up based on interest, city, or cause.

Events have a maximum capacity — so signups are auto-managed.

Upload event posters or banners to showcase causes better.

📍 3. Smart Check-ins (Geo/QR Attendance)
Volunteers check-in at events using location tracking (geo-tagging).

This ensures only those physically present are marked.

The app calculates volunteer hours automatically.

🏅 4. Badges & Recognition
Volunteers earn digital badges as they cross milestones (like 50 hours of service).

Admins can download or send a PDF report card of volunteer contributions — great for college credits or recognition.

💬 5. Real-Time Chat
During an event, volunteers and organizers can chat live via built-in messaging.

Admins can post important updates or alerts in real time.

Makes coordination smooth — like “Arrive at gate 2”, “Lunch break at 1 PM”, etc.

💳 6. Donations & Kits (Optional)
Volunteers or well-wishers can donate to causes or purchase kits (T-shirts, badges, etc.).

Payments are handled securely via Razorpay or Stripe.

Auto-generated receipts or certificates included.

📊 7. Admin Dashboard
Admins get access to a central dashboard with:

All events and participation stats

List of registered volunteers

CSV exports for reporting or funding applications

🔐 8. Security & Access Control
JWT-based secure login

Role-based access: Admins vs Volunteers

All data is safely stored in a SQL database (PostgreSQL)
